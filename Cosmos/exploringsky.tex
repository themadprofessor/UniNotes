\section{Basic Observations}
What can we see in the sky?
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Sun
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The big bright thing in the sky
	\item Don't look directly at the sun through a telescope, instead use white card placed below the eye piece.
	\item Provides heat and light for the Earth and all other bodies in the Solar System
	\item All most all energy on the Earth comes from the sun, the only exception being nuclear power
	\end{itemize}
\item The Moon
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The big bright thing in the sky during the night
	\item Roughly a million times fainter than the Sun
	\item Its a natural satelite and our closet astronomical neighbour
	\item Only visible due the light from the Sun reflecting of its surface
	\item Can be seen during the day, but much fainter due the Sun overpowering the light from it
	\item Has phases due to the orbit of the Moon around the Earth
	\item Synchronous rotation (same face always faces the Earth) due to the tidal forces from the Earth
	\end{itemize}
\item The Planets
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Fairly faint during the early morning and evening
	\item Only visible due to light from the Sun reflecting off the planet In or
	\item Some are easily spotted, and have been know since ancient times. In order of prominence:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Venus
		\item Jupiter
		\item Mars
		\item Saturn
		\item Mercury
		\end{itemize}
	\item The rest were discovered using telescopes
		\begin{itemize}
		\item 1781 - Uranus recognised as a new planet
		\item 1846 - Neptune predicted and observed
		\item 1930 - Pluto found - now classed a dwarf planet :( I liked Pluto
		\end{itemize}
	\item There are two ways to disinguish between a star and a planet:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Stars twinkle, planets don't
		\item Planets change position from night to night, hence planet in Greek means wanderer
		\end{enumerate}
	\item There are two types of planets:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Inferior - Mercury \& Venus
		\item Superior - Mars, Jupiter \& Saturn
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Mercury \& Venus are fairly close to the sun, making them only visible during the morning or evening
	\item Mercury is very difficult to see due to our latitude :(
	\end{itemize}
\item The stars
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Looks like pin-point of light, even through large telescopes, due to the fecking enormous distance - the closest star is \(2.5\times2-^5\) further away than the Sun
	\item Twinkling caused by atmospheric irregularities in the star
	\item Some ''bright spark'' grouped them into constellations, which appear to have been unchanged over thousands of years
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Most come from Greek mythology - i.e. Orion = the mighty hunter - yeah, I don't see it either
		\item There are 88 constellations - yay
		\end{itemize}
	\item Not all stars have the smae brightness or colour, this is due to the size, temperature and distance of the star
	\end{itemize}
\item The Milky Way
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Hard to see in populated areas due to light polution
	\item Looks like a diffuse band of light across the sky
	\item Telescopes can be used to pick out the stars
	\item Roughly \(2\times10^{11}\) stars
	\item Lens shaped due to buldge at the centre of the galaxy
	\end{itemize}
\item Nebulae
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Latin for cloud
	\item Covers everyting outisde of the solar system which is not start like
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Stellar remnant - Crab nebula
		\item Hot gas clouds - Orion nebula
		\item External galaxies - Andromeda nebula
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\item Asteroids
	\begin{itemize}
	\item First one discovered in 1801, called Ceres - was thought to be a missing planet between Mars and Jupiter
	\item Many more discovered, called minor planets/asteroids
	\item Can only be seen through a telescope - telescopic object
	\item Pretty much only found in the asteroid belt
	\item There is a metric fuckton of small ones in there - irregular in shape due to limited gravity to create a rounded shape
	\item There is another asteroid belt past Neptune (Kuiper Belt), which is one reason why Pluto was demoted to dwarf plane :(
	\end{itemize}
\item Artificial satellites
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Some "stars" appear to drift
	\item They are fairly high artifical satellites which reflect sunlight, with varing brightness as they rotate
	\item They suddenly disappear if they move into the Earth's shadow
	\end{itemize}
\item Comets
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Bright object which travels from the outer solar system to the Sun
	\item They are only seen once, except Halley's comet which has a period of 76 years
	\item As they approach the Sun, the become brighter and develop a tail as they heat up
	\item They appear stationary in the sky and are visible for many nights
	\end{itemize}
\item Meteors
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Objects which fall into the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, causing them to be quite bright and have a tail
	\item Can break up during their decent, causing a meteor shower
	\end{itemize}
\item Aurorae
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Glow from particals in the high atmosphere, which have been stimulated by collsions from charged particals from space
	\item Best seen at high latitudes
	\item Best known is the Aurora Borealis - Northen Lights
	\item Another is the Aurora Australis
	\end{itemize}
\item The Zodiacal Light
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Faint glow along the zodiac near the Sun
	\item Best seen along the equator, as twilight is the shortest there
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

From the list above, the Sun, Moon, Planets, Stars, Milky Way, Nebulae and Asteroids are regulary there to be seen whereas the rest are more unpredictable.

All astronomical bodies undergo diurnal motion. As is fairly obvious, the Sun moves across the sun from east to west, this is diurnal motion. This is caused by the rotation of the Earth, hense all astronomical bodies undergo this motion.

The Moon has a series of phases, based on its position within its orbit around the Earth, corrisponding to the amount of the moon which is illiminated by the sun and is facing the Earth. The cycle begins with the new moon, where the Earth-facing hemisphere is facing away from the Sun, and therefore is black. As the Moon rotates around its orbit, more of the Earth-facing hemisphere becomes illuminated, until the full moon, where the entire hemisphere is illuminated. Then, the proportion of the hemisphere which is illuminated decreases, until it reachs the new moon once more. When the Moon is a thin crescent, the Earth will appear fully illuminated from the Moon, earthshine.
